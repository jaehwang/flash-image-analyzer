# Feature Specification: Qualcomm Gang Image Creation Script

**Feature Branch**: `001-scripts-create-simple`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@scripts/create_simple_sample.py 파일은 퀄컴 명세에 맞게 gang image를 만드는 스크립트이다. rootfs를 하나 포함하고 있고 README.md 파일이 저장되어 있다."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature involves creating Qualcomm-compliant gang images with embedded rootfs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers/testers, Actions: generate gang images, Data: rootfs with README.md, Constraints: Qualcomm specification compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target use case - testing, development, or production?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Required gang image size limits or performance targets?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: generate test gang image for analysis
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on gang image structure and content
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Gang Image, Rootfs, Boot partitions
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties about use cases and performance targets"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a firmware analyst or embedded systems developer, I need to generate valid Qualcomm gang images containing realistic partition structures so that I can test gang image analysis tools and validate firmware parsing capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the script is executed, **When** a user runs the generation command, **Then** a valid Qualcomm gang image file is created with proper MBN partition structure
2. **Given** the generated gang image, **When** analyzed by gang image analysis tools, **Then** the image is recognized as valid Qualcomm format and all partitions are detected
3. **Given** the rootfs partition in the generated image, **When** extracted and analyzed, **Then** it contains a readable README.md file with filesystem metadata

### Edge Cases
- What happens when insufficient disk space is available for gang image generation?
- How does the system handle when the generated image exceeds expected size limits?
- What occurs if the rootfs creation fails during the generation process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate gang images that comply with Qualcomm specification format
- **FR-002**: System MUST create gang images containing properly structured MBN partitions for bootloader components
- **FR-003**: System MUST embed a functional rootfs partition within the generated gang image
- **FR-004**: Rootfs partition MUST contain a README.md file with basic filesystem information
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure generated gang images are recognizable by standard gang image analysis tools
- **FR-006**: System MUST create gang images with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific size limits not specified]
- **FR-007**: Generated gang images MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target use case - development testing only or broader usage?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: success/failure feedback mechanism not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Gang Image**: Complete firmware image file containing multiple partitions in Qualcomm format, includes bootloaders and rootfs
- **Rootfs Partition**: Root filesystem partition containing the basic file structure and README.md documentation file
- **MBN Partitions**: Qualcomm Multi-Boot Image partitions for bootloader components (SBL, APPSBL) with proper headers and load addresses
- **README.md File**: Documentation file embedded within the rootfs providing basic filesystem information and testing context
